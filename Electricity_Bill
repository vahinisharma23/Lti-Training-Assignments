/*You are assigned to develop a module to calculate the electricity bill based on below conditions:
The standard price per unit is Rs. 1.20.
• If number of units are less than 100 then standard price per unit will be applied.
• If it is less than or equal to 300 units then Rs. 2 will be charged for number of units over and above 100 units.
• If it is greater 300 units then Rs. 2 will charged for additional 200 units above 100 units and Rs. 3 will be charged for additional units above 300.*/
